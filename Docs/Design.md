# Overview
Project Rift is a 2D game inspired by space sim games such as Freelancer and Stellar Conflicts as well as the living in a simuated world experience that games like Mount and Blade provide. It is built
to run on Linux, Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS. It is a slower paced game that focuses on diplomacy and trade.
Rather than one large world, players can join local instances where their actions affect that instance. This allows
the players to see a more noticable affect on the game world rather than trying to balance it for large amounts of players.

# Property
Players can own planets and such and claim them for their faction of choice

# Trade
One source of income is trading from one galaxy to another. Trading generally consists of ferrying something
from one galaxy to another. Nothing special here.

# Factions
There are five seperate factions. Some are at war and some are at peace. You're part of one if you want. I'll flesh this out later.
Players in coop are part of the same faction.

# Combat
Combat and weapons targetting is automatic. The player is simply responsible for piloting the ship
while the crew mans the ship's weapons. 

Generally, incoming damage will impact the shield unil the shields deplete.
Incoming damage will then impact the armor until the armor depletes. After the armor
has depleted, individual components will begin to take damage while depleting the overall health.
The ship explodes when health drops to 0.

In addition, EMP damage will damage shields directly but no nothing to the hull while
Piercing damage will pierce shields and damage armor and hull directly.
