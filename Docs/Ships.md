# Ship Mechanics

- Shields
	- Surrounds the ship and prevents the hull from taking damage
    - Can regenerate using energy
- Armor
  - Protects vital core components from damage
  - Normally not nearly as strong as shields
  - Does not regenerate
- Hull
  - Contains vital parts of the ship
  - Damaging the hull will damage components
  - The ship explodes when the hull drops below 0
- Components
  - Contains things like the bridge, shield generators, additional armor, energy generators, weapons, crews quarters, and life support systems
  - Components are damaged by hull damage
  - Component health does not regenerate
  - Most components function at a reduced capacity after 30% damage
  - Most components cease to function after taking 70% damage

- Base Energy Storage
- Hull space for components
- Cargo space for other cargo

# Components

- Bridge
  - Most important part of the ship
  - Ship takes a massive debuff if it's destroyed or disabled
  - Produces little energy
- Shield generator
  - Needed to generate and regenerate shields
  - Uses massive energy
- Energy generator
  - Needed to generate and regenerate energy 
  - Uses massive fuel
  - Produces massive energy
- Capacitors
  - Stores power from the energy generator
- Crews Quarters
  - Houses crew members
  - Crew is needed to pilot a ship
  - Provides efficiency bonuses if ship is staffed properly
  - Provides debuff if ship is not staffed properly
  - Provides massive debuff if crew falls below a threshold
  - Needed to fend off boarders
  - Uses little energy
- Weapons
  - Used for combat 
  - Uses little to massive energy
- Life Support Systems
  - Needed for the crew to survive
  - Crew starts dying off if no life support exists
- Additional Armor
  - Armor covering vital areas of the ship
  - Adds to overall armor stat
  - Can serve as extra protection by taking damage as a component as well
